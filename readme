PHP Pivotal Tracker Class

This is a simple PHP class that connects to the Pivotal 
Tracker (pivotaltracker.com) API and lets you create a 
story in an existing project and assign tasks to that story. 
I wrote this because we switched to using Pivotal Tracker 
at work and I needed a way to insert stories from web based 
forms.
