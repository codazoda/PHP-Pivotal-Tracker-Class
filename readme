PHP Pivotal Tracker Class

This is a simple PHP class that connects to the Pivotal
Tracker API (pivotaltracker.com) and lets you request a
list of stories or create a new story in an existing
project.  You can also add labels and assign tasks to that
story.  I  wrote this because we switched to using Pivotal
Tracker at work and I needed a way to access it from web
based forms.

Documentation, should you need it, is available at the URL
below.
